## Abstract
This paper investigates the **physical layer security (PLS)** issue in **reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided millimeter-wave rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications** under the presence of multiple eavesdroppers and imperfect channel state information (CSI). The goal is to maximize the **worst-case secrecy energy efficiency (SEE)** of UAV via a **joint optimization of flight trajectory, UAV active beamforming and RIS passive beamforming**. By interacting with the dynamically changing UAV environment, real-time decision making per time slot is possible via deep reinforcement learning (DRL). To decouple the continuous optimization variables, we introduce a **twin twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TTD3)** to maximize the expected cumulative reward, which is linked to SEE enhancement. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method achieves greater secrecy energy savings than the traditional twin-deep deterministic policy gradient DRL (TDDRL)-based method. 

## TLDR

### System model: 
**RIS-aided mmWave UAV system** under the presence of **eavesdroppers** and **imperfect channel state information (CSI)** </br>

### Solution: 
A **Twin-TD3 (TTD3) algorithm** to decouple the joint optimization of:
1. UAV active beamforming and RIS passive beamforming 
2. UAV flight trajectory

We adopt **double DRL framework**, where the 1st and 2nd agent provides the policy for task (1) and (2), respectively.

## How to use this repo
User can train two types of algorithm for training:
1. Twin DDPG is [TDDRL algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2021.3081464)

python3 main_test.py --drl td3
```

`load_and_plot.py` is the python file to plot the (i) Rewards, (ii) Sum Secrecy Rate (SSR), (iii) Secrecy Energy Efficient (SEE), (iv) UAV Trajectory, (v) RIS configs for each episode in one experiments
```shell
# plot everything for each episode
python3 load_and_plot.py --path <RELATIVE_PATH> --ep_num 300
```

`plot_ssr.py` is the python file to plot the final episode's SSR for the 4 benchmarks in the paper
```shell
# plot ssr
python3 plot_ssr.py
```

`plot_see.py` is the python file to plot the final episode's SSR for the 4 benchmarks in the paper
```shell
# plot see
python3 plot_see.py
